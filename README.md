# Pedal-Libraries
Useful parts for guitar pedal layouts in eagle.

This is still a work in progress. If you would like to help out, feel free to fork this and shoot me a pull request.

If you aren't into editing parts yourself but have some ideas, feel free to [request a part](https://github.com/kgullion/Pedal-Libraries/issues/new) and I'll check it out.

Thanks!
